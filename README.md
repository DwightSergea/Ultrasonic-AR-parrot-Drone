This project was inspired by https://github.com/vdkd888/droneproject whereby the goal is to make the drone more autonomous by utilizing ultrasonic sensors and camera's. The project Hack-A-Drone, https://github.com/roberthorvers/hack-a-drone, will be applied to this project whereby the autonomous drones shall fly as a swarm.
